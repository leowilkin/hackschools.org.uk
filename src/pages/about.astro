		<p>We're still very much under development at the moment, but here's what we can tell you.</p>
		<div>
			<b>Our Mission:</b>
			<p>Our mission at HackSchools UK is to cultivate and empower young STEM leaders from diverse backgrounds within schools and colleges across the UK. By fostering an environment of learning and exploration, we aim to encourage these leaders to educate and inspire others while promoting leadership, collaboration, and technological innovation through the art of hacking.</p>

			<b>What is hacking?</b>
			<p>When we refer to hacking, we mean it in the sense of changing something for good - like hacking a broken clock, or hacking a school lunch menu so it formats properly.<br>You can hack pretty much anything.</p>
